I was born in Kirov, Russia and grew up in a nearby town in 1992. Since 
childhood, I have had a passion for engineering mechanisms and a keen interest 
in physics, which continued throughout my schooling.
⠀
At the age of six, my parents bought our first computer, which initially served
as a source of entertainment through playing games. However, soon after, I 
began modifying components of games and the operating system, finding it to be
a fascinating challenge. As I created mods and maps for games, I stumbled upon 
HiAsm, a non-coding IDE, which marked my first steps into programming.
⠀
As my curiosity grew, I wanted to create more components in HiAsm, but soon 
realized that I needed to use programming languages like FreePascal or Delphi.
Unfortunately, I didn't have access to the internet at that time, so someone 
gave me a book on Delphi 7. Of course I couldn't create new components for 
HiAsm, it was too difficult for me. But this didn't matter, because I could 
make program using Delphi🎉. [Photo](early_photo.jpg)
